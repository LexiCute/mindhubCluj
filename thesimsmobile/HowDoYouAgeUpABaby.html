<p><strong>Baby-Toddler:</strong>To do this, you must do interactions with the baby and complete sets of family event. It will take a day or two depending on your activeness in the game. Once you see a blue birthday cake icon on top of the bassinet, tap on it. It will age up the baby into a toddler.</p>

<p><strong>Toddler-Child</strong>Children will age up after a few days as well. Just like babies and toddlers, they will have a blue birthday cake icon above their heads when they're ready to grow up. Tap the birthday cake icon to age your child into an adult. There is no teen life stage in The Sims Mobile.</p>

<p><strong>MORE</strong>Your toddler will stay a toddler for about 2-3 days, then will age up into a child. Then she will stay a child for about 3-4 days and then become an adult. If you have a available slot open, you can promote her through the family portrait and she'll become a sim you can control.</p>
<p><strong>You can't get rid of an unwanted baby!</strong>
